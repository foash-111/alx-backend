"i18n" refers to internationalization in the context of Flask,
a popular micro web framework for Python.
Internationalization (often abbreviated as i18n,
where 18 stands for the number of letters between the first "i" and the last "n" in the word "internationalization") 
is the process of designing and preparing your application to be usable in different languages.
This involves marking texts in your application that need to be translated and setting up mechanisms to manage translations.
