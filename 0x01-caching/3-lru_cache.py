"""
What LRU means: LRU, or "Least Recently Used,"
is a more sophisticated (developed) cache eviction (pop) policy
that tracks the order of data usage.
When the cache is full,
the data that has not accessed for the longest time is evicted (poped) first.
This policy is particularly effective in scenarios where
the most recently used data is likely to be accessed again soon.
